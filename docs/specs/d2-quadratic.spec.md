## Overview

Votes cost quadratically increasing credits, enabling preference intensity expression while limiting plutocratic influence.

**Constraints**: ~140K | **Complexity**: Low

---

## Background

Quadratic voting addresses fundamental governance challenges:

- **Preference Intensity**: One-token-one-vote cannot distinguish between mild preferences and strong convictions
- **Plutocracy Prevention**: Linear voting gives whales disproportionate power over collective decisions
- **Minority Protection**: Small groups with intense preferences deserve voice against apathetic majorities
- **Economic Efficiency**: QV approximates optimal allocation of collective decision-making influence

Traditional voting treats all preferences equally, regardless of intensity. The quadratic model (cost = votes^2) allows expressing conviction strength while ensuring diminishing returns for concentrated power.

```

### Key Constraints

1. **Credit Ownership**: Voter must own credited voice credits proven via merkle inclusion
2. **Quadratic Cost**: Vote cost equals numVotes squared exactly
3. **Sufficient Balance**: Credits spent cannot exceed available credits
4. **Binary Choice**: Choice must be 0 (against) or 1 (for)
5. **Positive Votes**: Must cast at least one vote

## Effects

| Aspect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Preference Intensity** | Voters can signal conviction strength through credit allocation |
| **Anti-Plutocracy** | Diminishing returns prevent whale domination of outcomes |
| **Minority Voice** | Intense minorities can outweigh apathetic majorities on key issues |
| **Strategic Depth** | Voters must budget credits across multiple proposals |
| **Economic Efficiency** | Approaches optimal collective decision-making in mechanism design |

---

## Security Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **Credit Farming** | Credits tied to identity/membership duration, not transferable tokens |
| **Sybil Attacks** | Identity verification or minimum stake required for credit allocation |
| **Credit Overflow** | Use 64-bit arithmetic; cap maximum credits per period |
| **Vote Splitting** | Nullifier per identity per proposal prevents splitting across accounts |
| **Collusion Rings** | Private voting prevents coordination on specific vote counts |
| **Credit Manipulation** | Credits allocated at snapshot; cannot be modified mid-vote |

---

## Implementation Challenges

1. **Credit Distribution**
   - How are voice credits initially allocated? (equal, stake-weighted, reputation-based)
   - Credit refresh rate for ongoing governance
   - Cross-proposal credit budgeting complexity

2. **Identity Requirements**
   - Pure QV requires Sybil resistance
   - Options: proof-of-humanity, social vouching, stake-based identity
   - Privacy vs. Sybil resistance tradeoffs

3. **UX Complexity**
   - Users must understand quadratic cost structure
   - Need clear UI showing cost/benefit of additional votes
   - Credit budget tracking across active proposals

4. **Credit Accounting**
   - Track credits spent vs. remaining
   - Handle proposal cancellation (credit refunds)
   - Prevent double-spending of credits

---

## Derivatives

1. **Private Quadratic Voting** - Extends QV with commit-reveal scheme to hide both choice and vote count until reveal phase.

2. **Budget-Capped QV** - Each voter receives fixed credit budget per voting period (e.g., 100 credits/month). Forces prioritization across proposals.

3. **QV for Fund Allocation** - Allocate treasury funds across competing proposals using QV. Vote counts determine proportional funding. Similar to Gitcoin grants.

4. **Cross-Proposal QV** - Credits are shared across simultaneous proposals. Voting on one reduces available credits for others.

5. **Conviction-Weighted QV** - Initial credit allocation based on governance participation history.

---

## Use Cases

1. **Protocol Upgrade Prioritization** - Multiple proposed upgrades, limited resources. Members allocate credits across proposals. Strong preferences on critical upgrades can concentrate votes.

2. **Grant Committee Allocation** - Quarterly grant budget. Committee members use QV to allocate across projects. Funding proportional to QV vote totals.

3. **Feature Request Prioritization** - Users receive credits based on TVL contribution. QV determines development roadmap priority.

4. **Contentious Binary Decision** - QV reveals intensity of opposition vs. mild majority. Small passionate group can prevent change they consider existential.

## Key Formulas

```
Cost:       creditsSpent = numVotes * numVotes
Balance:    voteCost <= totalCredits
Commitment: Poseidon(choice, numVotes, creditsSpent, proposalId, voteSalt)
CreditNote: Poseidon(pkX, pkY, totalCredits, creditSalt)
Nullifier:  hash(sk, proposalId)
Choice:     {0 = against, 1 = for} (binary only, no abstain)
```
