## Overview

Zero-knowledge circuit for commit-reveal voting that hides voter choices while maintaining verifiable voting power.

**Constraints**: ~150K | **Complexity**: Low

---

## Background

Private voting addresses fundamental governance challenges:

- **Anti-Coercion**: Public votes enable bribery and social pressure; hidden ballots protect autonomy
- **Honest Preference Expression**: Voters reveal true preferences when choices cannot be observed or punished
- **Governance Integrity**: Prevents last-minute vote manipulation based on observing others' choices
- **Democratic Standards**: Secret ballot is a foundational democratic principle worldwide

> "In traditional governance systems, secret ballots are standard practice. On-chain governance typically exposes all votes publicly, enabling sophisticated vote buying schemes."

template PrivateVoting(TREE_DEPTH) {
    // ===== Public Inputs =====
    signal input voteCommitment;
    signal input proposalId;
    signal input votingPower;
    signal input merkleRoot;

    // ===== Private Inputs =====
    signal input pkX, pkY, sk;
    signal input noteHash, noteValue, noteSalt;
    signal input choice, voteSalt;
    signal input merklePath[TREE_DEPTH];
    signal input merkleIndex;

    // ===== 1. Verify Governance Token Note =====
    component note = PoseidonRegularNote();
    note.pkX <== pkX;
    note.pkY <== pkY;
    note.value <== noteValue;
    note.tokenType <== 0; // Governance token type
    note.salt <== noteSalt;
    note.out === noteHash;

    // ===== 2. Verify Note Inclusion in Snapshot =====
    component merkle = MerkleProof(TREE_DEPTH);
    merkle.leaf <== noteHash;
    merkle.root <== merkleRoot;
    for (var i = 0; i < TREE_DEPTH; i++) {
        merkle.path[i] <== merklePath[i];
    }
    merkle.index <== merkleIndex;

    // ===== 3. Verify Ownership =====
    component ownership = ProofOfOwnershipStrict();
    ownership.sk <== sk;
    ownership.pkX <== pkX;
    ownership.pkY <== pkY;

    // ===== 4. Voting Power Equals Note Value =====
    votingPower === noteValue;

    // ===== 5. Validate Choice (0, 1, or 2) =====
    component choiceValid = LessThan(8);
    choiceValid.in[0] <== choice;
    choiceValid.in[1] <== 3;
    choiceValid.out === 1;

    // ===== 6. Create Vote Commitment =====
    // Commitment includes proposalId to prevent cross-proposal replay
    component commit = Poseidon(4);
    commit.inputs[0] <== choice;
    commit.inputs[1] <== votingPower;
    commit.inputs[2] <== proposalId;
    commit.inputs[3] <== voteSalt;
    commit.out === voteCommitment;
}

component main {public [voteCommitment, proposalId, votingPower, merkleRoot]} =
    PrivateVoting(20);
```

### Key Constraints

1. **Token Ownership**: Voter must own governance tokens proven via note hash and merkle inclusion
2. **Snapshot Validity**: Note must exist in the historical merkle tree at snapshot time
3. **Voting Power Accuracy**: Declared voting power must exactly match note value
4. **Valid Choice**: Vote choice must be within allowed range (0, 1, or 2)
5. **Commitment Binding**: Vote commitment cryptographically binds choice to voter and proposal

## Effects

| Aspect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Vote Privacy** | Choice hidden until reveal phase; observers cannot determine individual votes |
| **Anti-Coercion** | Voters cannot prove their vote to potential bribers or coercers |
| **Governance Integrity** | Prevents strategic voting based on observing others' choices |
| **Verifiable Participation** | Voting power publicly verifiable without revealing choice |
| **Double-Vote Prevention** | Nullifier system prevents same tokens from voting twice |

---

## Security Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **Vote Buying via Receipts** | Commitment scheme ensures voters cannot prove their choice to buyers |
| **Double Voting** | Nullifier derived from note + proposalId prevents reuse |
| **Reveal Phase Manipulation** | Time-locked reveal phase; unrevealed votes can be defaulted |
| **Snapshot Manipulation** | Use block hash from distant past; merkle root committed on-chain |
| **Coerced Key Disclosure** | Consider supporting decoy votes or key rotation mechanisms |
| **Front-running Reveals** | Batch reveal in single transaction or commit-reveal on reveal too |

---

## Implementation Challenges

1. **Reveal Coordination**
   - All voters must reveal within time window for tally
   - Unrevealed votes complicate final counts
   - Consider economic incentives for timely reveals (deposit returned on reveal)

2. **Snapshot Infrastructure**
   - Need reliable historical merkle tree construction
   - Storage of historical roots on-chain
   - Efficient proof generation for users with many notes

3. **Nullifier Management**
   - Unique nullifier per voter per proposal
   - Nullifier = hash(sk, proposalId) to prevent linkage across proposals
   - Nullifier registry must be checked efficiently

4. **Vote Tallying**
   - Reveal phase collects all votes for counting
   - Need secure aggregation mechanism
   - Consider on-chain vs. off-chain tallying tradeoffs

---

## Derivatives

1. **Shielded Vote Tallying** - Aggregate votes computed without revealing individual choices using homomorphic commitments or MPC. Final tally proven correct via ZK proof over all commitments. Enables privacy even after voting ends.

2. **Anti-Bribery Voting** - Extended scheme where voters can generate fake receipts indistinguishable from real ones. Potential bribers cannot verify payment, making bribery economically irrational.

3. **Multi-Round Voting** - Sequential voting rounds where earlier results inform later choices. Each round uses fresh commitments. Useful for runoff elections or iterative consensus building.

4. **Emergency Voting** - Shortened commit-reveal cycle for time-sensitive proposals. Higher quorum requirements compensate for reduced deliberation time. Automatic reveal after emergency period.

5. **Weighted Private Voting** - Voting power derived from multiple factors (tokens, reputation, tenure) computed privately. ZK proof demonstrates correct weight calculation without revealing component values.

---

## Use Cases

1. **Protocol Parameter Changes** - DAO proposes fee adjustment; token holders vote privately; whales cannot signal to influence smaller holders.

2. **Treasury Grant Allocation** - Multiple project proposals compete for funding; private voting prevents coordination attacks.

3. **Contentious Governance Decisions** - Vocal minority cannot identify and pressure opposing voters; true community sentiment emerges.

4. **Board Elections** - Private voting prevents vote trading between candidates.
